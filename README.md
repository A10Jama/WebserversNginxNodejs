## Web Servers, NodeJS, and NGINX
This Readme.md file provides an overview of web servers, NodeJS, and NGINX, as well as their use cases, dependencies, and related technologies.

### Web Servers
Web servers are software programs that accept HTTP requests from clients, such as web browsers, and return HTTP responses, usually in the form of web pages. When a user enters a URL in their browser, the browser sends a DNS request to obtain the IP address of the domain name. The web server then responds by sending the requested page via HTTP.

### NodeJS
NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Unlike traditional web servers, NodeJS is event-driven and single-threaded, allowing for efficient handling of multiple requests. NodeJS is commonly used for developing real-time chatbots, streaming web applications, and microservices architecture.

### NGINX
NGINX is a high-performance web server that is known for its speed and scalability. NGINX uses worker processes and connections to handle requests and responses. One worker connection can handle up to 1024 requests, making NGINX one of the fastest web servers available. NGINX is commonly used by major online companies such as Google, Netflix, and Adobe.

- Facilitating Wireless Connectivity
- Developing Collaboration Tools
- Enabling Server-side proxy
- Crafting Web Extraction and Automation solutions
- Developing Single-Page Applications
- 
- Crafting Microservices Architecture
### Use Cases of NodeJS
NodeJS has a wide range of use cases, including developing single-page applications, big data and analytics solutions, and web extraction and automation solutions. Other use cases include developing collaboration tools, crafting real-time data tracking dashboards, and enabling server-side proxies for wireless connectivity.

### Dependencies of NodeJS

- Production Dependencies
- Development Dependencies
- Peer Dependencies
- Optional Dependencies
- Bundled Dependencies
- These dependencies demonstrate the complexity of NodeJS and the ecosystem around it.

### NPM
NPM is a software package manager and installer that allows developers to easily manage and share code packages. The NPM registry contains over 800,000 code packages, and open-source developers use NPM to share software. Many organizations also use NPM to manage private development.

### Reverse Proxy
A reverse proxy is a backend tool used by system administrators to sit between a user and a web server. Instead of connecting directly to the server, the reverse proxy forwards the request to the server, which then returns a response. Reverse proxies can be used for centralized logging, configurable frontend, network protection and privacy, caching, and load balancing. NGINX is a popular tool for implementing reverse proxies.
